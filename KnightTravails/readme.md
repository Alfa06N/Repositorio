# Knight Travails

This project implements a solution to the "Knight's Travails" problem using graphs and the breadth first search (BFS) algorithm. The main task is to determine the shortest path a chess knight can take from a starting position to a target position on a standard chess board (8x8).

## Features

- Simulates the movement of the chess knight on a standard 8x8 board.
- Finds the shortest path from a starting position to a target position.
- Returns the full path in readable format.
- Use of data structures such as queues and sets to manage the search.
