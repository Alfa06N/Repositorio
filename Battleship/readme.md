## **Description**

This project brings the timeless Battleship game to the browser. Players take turns attacking the opponent's ships on a grid-based game board. The goal is to sink all of the opponent's ships by guessing their hidden positions. The game features smooth gameplay, a responsive interface, but simple AI opponents for now.
